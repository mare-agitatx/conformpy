# ConformPy

## Welcome

This is my code for representing the graphs of complex functions by means of
the conformal map representation

In order to do so, this python script utilizes numpy and matplotlib to
generate the correct parametrization and then represent the chosen function

Be warned! This is the first working version of the python script: I
debugged it as much as I could but it is yet NOT TESTED, I am just 
adding it to show the code itself since it is in a working yet untested
state...
 
I am still practicing how to commit code here and how to properly debug
and then test, I will soon test this code, fix the documentation and make
this code robust

## Dependencies

matplotlib, numpy, sys, configparser for conformpy.py

everything listed for conformpy.py and pytest for tests.py

## Installation

Just clone the repository

## Usage

As an example, suppose your configuration file is "config.txt"; you could run:
```
python conformpy.py config.txt
```
